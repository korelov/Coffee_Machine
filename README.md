#About

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make 
yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; 
but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming
a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, 
and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three 
types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects 
the money.

#Learning outcomes
